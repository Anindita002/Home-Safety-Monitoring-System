# Home-Safety-Monitoring-System
 In this project, an Arduino Uno R3 Board, PIR Sensor module, Smoke Sensor module has been used.
Home security system can provide top notch security by detecting unwanted presence and alarming everyone in case of danger such as fire hazard.
Arduino; functions almost as a small computer; will be connected with different sensors and GPIO devices in order to achieve our objectives.
After building the compact security system, a user can keep track of what is happening in that particular area even when he/she is not present in that place.
When a PIR motion sensor detects an unusual movement inside the home, it will provide essential information and transmit it to a smartphone using a web application.
Despite of security breaches, if suddenly some unwanted disaster occurs such as fire, the smoke sensor will instantly detect it and will notify us via Bluetooth.
Moreover, the smoke sensor will use an LCD to show a message whether everything is fine or not.
The advantage of this system is that it covers different areas when it comes to security and it can be easily made using Arduino, sensors, GPIO devices and I/O devices.
